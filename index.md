                                        When sending data from Artemis to computer, the less number of bytes being sent, the more efficient the transmission would be.
                                        So when the number of bytes of data in string format is less than that in float format, the second approach is preferable in which 
                                        the rest of work of converting string to float is done by computer. Otherwise, the first approach is better.

                                        Because I noticed the default I2C address of ToF was 0x52 from datasheet in prelab.0x52 in binary form is (01010010)B and 0x29 in binary form is (00101001)B.
                                        So 0x29 was just the result of shifting the address 0x52 one bit to the right. And I also used "getI2CAdress" function from SparkFun_VL53L1X
                                        libaray to get the address which was the default address 0x52.</p>

                                        Discuss the pros/cons of each mode, and think about which one could work on the final robot.</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-4">>The VL53L1X has three distance modes: short, medium and long. Their maximum distances in dark are 136 cm, 290 cm, 300 cm respectively.
                                        Using the short mode will enable the robot to get the most accurate distance in short-range dark environment but  will limit the "visual"
                                        distance of the robot so that it cannot see farther obstacles and turn promptly. However, short mode provides the longest distance measurement
                                        under strong ambient light (135cm) compared to the other two modes (76/73 cm). So, short mode works best in strong light environment. As for the 
                                        medium mode and long mode, they both offer a longer detection range but behave badly under strong light. Since the longer the detecton range is, 
                                        the longer it takes to measure, the medium mode is preferable in dark. To conclude, I think the short mode is most suitable for our robots under 
                                        strong light and the medium mode is most suitable in dark and in normal environment.

                                    <p class="mb-4">I tested the ToF from 100mm to 1300mm. It seems that the accuracy of ToF is still very high, the standard deviation of the error is 
                                        relatively small, and it flatuated from 1.1 mm to 1.6 mm.

                                    <h6 class="mb-4">1. Many distance sensors are based on infrared trasmission. Discuss a couple, highlight the differences
                                     in their fuctionality and the pros/cons of each.</h6>
                                    <p>There are two types of infrared sensors: active and passive. Active infrared sensors are linear-controlled 
                                        detectors, and their control range is a narrow and long space with a linear distribution. The active infrared sensor also
                                        has the advantages of small size, light weight, low power consumption, easy operation and installation, and
                                        low price. Since the lens surface of the optical system is exposed in the air, it is easily contaminated by dust
                                        and other sundries. The passive infrared sensor itself does not emit any energy but passively receives and detects infrared radiation
                                        from the environment. Once the human body infrared radiation comes in, the pyroelectric device will generate a sudden
                                        change of electrical signal after being focused by the optical system, and an alarm will be issued. In the digital passive infrared
                                        sensors, the weak electrical signal output by the pyroelectric sensor is directly input to a powerful microprocessor, and all signal 
                                        conversion, amplification, filtering, etc. are carried out in a processing chip, thereby improving the passive infrared sensor's reliability.
                                        Cons: When the equipment is not firmly installed, when the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is large, or when multiple sensors 
                                        transmit signals at the same time, it is easy to cause false alarms. 
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h6 class="mb-4">2.Try out some settings of timing budgets, and discuss your choice of settings related to the anticipated speed of your robot. </h6>
                                    <p>Accoarding to 2.5.2 in the datasheet, increasing the timing budget increases the maximum distance the device can range and improves the repeatability error. However, average consumption
                                        augments accordingly. Since I choose the long mode, I want to make the range of ToF as large as possible, while
                                        the time budget is small. 140 ms is the timing budget which allows the maximum distance of 4 m to reached under long distance mdoe.</p>
                                    <center><img src="assets/video/lab3/mdaretb.png"/></center><br>
                                    <p>Accoarding to this figure of maximum distance vs different timing budget from datasheet, I tried 140 ms timing budget and 200 ms under long distance.</p>
                                    
                                    <center><img src="assets/video/lab3/140long.gif"/></center><br>
                                    <p>The above picture is the test result of setting the timing budget to 140ms in long mode. It can be seen that, its easurement time, internal measurement period and singal rate was 
                                        around 96 ms, 100ms and 2500 respectively.</p>
                                    <center><img src="assets/video/lab3/200long.gif"/></center><br>
                                    <p>The above picture is the test result of setting the timing budget to 200ms in long mode. It can be seen that, its easurement time, internal measurement period and signal rate was 
                                        180 ms, 100ms and 1000 respectively. <br>
                                        Through the above tests, it can be seen that when both timimg budgets can achieve the same long-distance measurement, the tb of 140ms can obtain data updates with higher frequency
                                        , and I also noticed that using the tb of 200ms is more prone to signal fail. So in the following experiments I will choose long mode and tb of 140 ms.</p>

                                    <h6 class="mb-4">3. Try rapidly changing the distance from the sensor to an object and describe what happens. Consider how this will impact your motion implementation in future labs.</h6>
                                    <p>I programmed the StatusandRate program to Artemis. After testing, I found that when the ToF distance measurement is relatively small (the obstacles ahead are relatively close), 
                                    the measurement status is generally accurate, and the status is basically good.</p>
                                    <center><img src="assets/video/lab3/short.gif"/></center><br>
                                    <p>When the ToF distance measurement is relatively large (the obstacles ahead are relatively far), 
                                        the measurement status is generally accurate, and the status is basically good.</p>
                                    <center><img src="assets/video/lab3/long.gif"/></center><br>
                                    <p>This result made me realize that using ToF When measuring distances, the measurement at close range is more reliable, and when the distance is farther, use ToF less.</p>

                                    <p>I connected the IMU to the Artmeis board using I2C wiring, ran Example1_Basics.<br>
                                    AD0_VAL is the value of the last bit of the I2C address. On the Sparkfun 9DoF IMU breakout the default is 1, and when the ADR jumper is closed the value becomes 0.
                                    When AD0_VAL equals 1, the Artmeis could not find IMU through I2C. When AD0_VAK equals 0, it worked.<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When IMU was placed on my table, it measured 0g on the x and y axes and +1g on the z axis. Here are the results of accelerometer when I rotated the IMU around the x and y axes.
                                        But when I rotated the IMU around z axis, it was unable to distinguish between that and the acceleration provided through Earth's gravitational pull. This is because the 
                                        accelerometer can only gauge the orientation of a stationary item with relation to Earth's surface.

                                    <p>From these figures, I couldn't decide the cutoff frequency in low pass filter. So I performed FFT on the data from accelerometer when I rotated IMU.</p>
                                    <center><img src="assets/video/lab3/normalX.png"/></center>
                                    <p>From this frequency response plot, I think the cutoff frequency is around 10 Hz. My computer recieved 297 samples in 9.5 seconds, 
                                        so the sampling rate is 297/9.5 = 31.2632. Given that fc = 1/(2piRC), T=1/sample_rate, alpha=T/(T+RC), I get T = 0.03198, RC = 1/(20pi), alpha = 0.6677.
                                        Using these parameters, I am able to design a low pass filter:

                                    <p><br>I found that roll and pitch from accelerometer have more high frequency content, while roll and pitch from gyroscope change more smoothly. 
                                        The values of roll and pitch from gyroscope are related to the initial placement angle of IMU and have errors, which will accumulate over time.

                                    <p>In order to estimate the range of car speed, I attached a ToF sensor on the front of the car with double-sided tape,

                                    <p>And then set up the Artemis to send ToF distance measurement to the computer over Bluetooth. By doing so, I could monitor 
                                        and store the distance data while speeding up the car with remoter. Since the speed of range is battery-dependent, 
                                        I used a fully charged one to test. On the computer end, I set up a notification handler to store the distance data with time stamps.<br></p>

                                    <p>Then I positioned the car around 4 meters away from the door and speeded it up until it hit the door (pillows for cushioning).</p>

                                    <p>By taking the derivative of the distance respect to time, I got the plot of the speed of the car. In this plot, we can find that there is 
                                        a desired acceleration and a deceleration process caused by hitting the pillowss. And we are able to estimate that the speed range is 
                                        -3.7 to 3.7 meters per second (the car is able to move in both directions).

                                    in a fairly straight line, record a video of your robot following a straight line (e.g. a piece of tape) for at least 2m/6ft.

                                    that the motor control signal could change its value in 5 ms and it's much faster than the motor response time and fast enough to control the motor. 
                                    So generating a faster PWM signal would not bring any benefits.

                                <h3 class=" text-center text-uppercase mb-0">Task A: Don’t Hit the Wall!!</h3><br>
                                <h6>PID controller:</h6>
                                <p>I used arduino PID library to design distance controller. I set the output limits of distance controller to -255 to 255, 
                                    Taking front ToF reading as input and motor duty cycle as output, the negative feedback control of distance is realized.
                                    One of the reason that I chose this library to implement PID control is that its build-in function has already taken care of Derivative kick
                                    problem.
                                    In addition, I also simply designed a z-axis angular acceleration PID controller with gyroscope reading as input and motor duty cycle as 
                                    output. The output of this controller is superimposed on the duty cycle of the left and right motors, one positive and one negative, 
                                    so as to ensure that the robot runs straight ( need to implement a calibration factor to both motor)
                                </p>
                                <h6>Frequency:</h6>
                                <p>by logging all data (time stamped sensor values and motor outputs),  I calculated that the average time to execute a loop is about 323 ms</p>

                                
                                <h6>Deadband:</h6>
                                <p>I wrote a scaling function that converts the output from your PID controller to an output for which the motors can actually react.
                                    And I set the deacband of both motors from -30 to 30.
                                </p> 
                                <center><img src="assets/video/lab6/deadban.png" /></center><br>
                                <h6>Motor drivers:</h6>
                                <p>When I tried Task A, at first I found that the motor was very slow to respond. Later I found that when I was dealing with coasting 
                                    and active breaking modes, I set the active breaking modes to be used when the duty cycle is 0. So when I set it to coasting modes, the problem was solved.</p>

                                <h6>A reasonable range of the proportional controller gain:</h6>
                                <p>The robot is initially placed from 2 meters to 4 meters away from the obstacle, and the target distance is 300mm. Then the maximum value of error in the initial 
                                    state is -3700. At the same time, due to the scaling function of motors, the maximum duty cycle given is 225, then the maximum proportional gain can be calculated
                                    as Kp = 225/3700 = 0.06. So the actual Kp value must be smaller than this value, but in the same order of magnitude. So I started tuning from 0.01.</p> 
                                
                                <h6>The range and sampling time for TOF sensor:</h6>
                                <p>According to lab 3, I discovered that to make the range of ToF as large as possible, while the time budget is small. 140 ms is the timing budget which allows 
                                    the maximum distance of 4 m to reached under long distance mdoe. Therefore I set the ToF to long distance mode and 140 ms budget time.</p>

                                <h6>Parameter Tuning:</h6>
                                <p>Because the integral part of PID Controller will always introduce overshoot, which will increase the risk of the robot hitting the wall, so I use PD control, 
                                    Kp adjusts the response speed of the robot, and Kd suppresses overshoot. Also I found out that the initial position at different distances requires different PD parameters.
                                    The farther the distance is, the Kp needs to be reduced accordingly, otherwise the robot will hit the wall.</p>

                                <p>Through this series of parameter adjustments, I was able to design a reasonable PD controller to make the robot drive from a distance 
                                    of 2 to 4 meters away from the wall to a position of 300mm, and I found that the maximum speed that the robot can achieve is 
                                    largely affected by the initial The effect of position, the further away from the wall, the greater its maximum speed.</p>

                        <p>&emsp;Considering that the Kalman Filter will be combined with PID control in future experiments, I will keep the scaling function for motor output when doing the step response test.<br></p>
                        <p>First I set the input of motor to 70 and here are the ToF readings, calculated speed and motor input.</p>

                        <p>From the figrues above, we can have that the steady state of the speed is around 1500 mm/s. And given the motor input is 70, d = u/v = 70/1500 = 0.04667<br>
                            Then I measured 90% rise time, it would be 784 ms or 0.784s. Therefore m = 0.01589

                        <h6 class="text-secondary  text-uppercase mb-0" >2. Kalman Filter Setup</h6>
                        <p>First try to reason about ballpark numbers for the variance of process and measurement. And we know that their relative values determines how much you trust your model versus your sensor and
                            the process noise is dependent onf sampling rate. I averaged the sampling rate and got 10.21 ms per sample
                        </p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/nosie.png" /></center><br>

                        <h6 class="text-secondary  text-uppercase mb-0" >3. Sanity Check Your Kalman Filter</h6>
                        <p>In order to implement Kalman Filter on the computer, I define the kf function, whose input are mu at last time, sigma at last time, u(input), y(measurement), 
                            Ad (discrete A matrix), Bd (discrete B matrix) and C matrix</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/kf.png" /></center><br>
                        <p>Loop through all of the data from my pre-recorded run, while calling this kf function.</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/loop.png" /></center><br>
                        <p>After the first run, I get the following plot. The KF estimate in the figure is almost the same as the ToF reading, indicating 
                            that the Kalman filter trusts the results of the ToF reading very much at this time, I should increase the measurement noise Sigma_z.</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/pyekf1.png" /></center><br>
                        <p>Next I increased the measurement noise from 40 to 400. Below is the plot I get.In this figure, I found that the waveform of KF is much smoother than the previous one, 
                            and is closer to the actual state than ToF reading (because the sampling rate is higher than the frequency of ToF data acquisition, the ToF reading curve looks a little more discrete).
                            It shows that Kalman Filter is less confident in ToF measurement than before, and can better balance expected measurement and actual measurement.</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/pyekf2.png" /></center><br>

                        <h6 class="text-secondary  text-uppercase mb-0" >4. Implement the Kalman Filter on the Robot</h6>
                        <p>First, I included the BasicLinearAlgebra library and wrote the Kalman filter function according to part 3.</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/code.png" /></center><br>

                        <p> In each iteration, the general loop time is within 0.005-0.03s (5-30ms). When assigning a value to Delta_t, because this value is too small and the Matrix precision is limited, 
                            the Delta_t matrix will become 0. So I modified the library function and changed the data type of all matrices from float to double, and the problem was solved.</p>
                        <p> Then I found that mu and Sigma both became NaN after the second iteration. It took me a long time to find out that the inversion of a 1by1 matrix in the BasicLinearAlgebra 
                            library incorrectly returns 1. But fortunately, the inverse matrix is exactly 1by1, and I can directly divide by sigma_m when calculating Kalman Gain, instead of inverting it.</p>
                        <p>Here is the plot of ToF reading and KF estimate. Orange: KF estimate; Blue: ToF reading.</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/kfc0.1.png" /></center><br>
                        <p>Then I found that although the KF estimate will eventually approach the ToF reading, the KF estimate will increase to around 2500 at first. 
                            So I wondered if the value I initialized KF sigma was too large, because sigma represents the uncertainty of estimate. So I made two additional attempts, setting the sigma to a 
                            very large value and a very small value</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/kfc1000.png" /></center><br>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab7/kfc0.001.png" /></center><br>
                        <p>But the results were even worse. So it shouldn't be an initialization problem. Then I thought that Delta_T needs to be calculated for each iteration of KF, 
                            maybe the Delta_T calculated for the first time is too large, because in the first calculation, Delta_T is calculated by the current time (acquired from the function millis())  
                            minus the previous time acquired from the function millis() in setup function, so I did a modification: in the first KF iteration, run through all Kalman filter 
                            calculations except updating mu and sigma just to get the previous time. The rest of the iterations remain the same. Fortunately, with such modification, the problem is solved.
                        Here are the plots of ToF readings and KF estimate. I also zoomed in on a section where the filtering effect of the KF estimate can be better observed. </p>

                        <p>&emsp;By using Arduino PID library, I created a PID controller that allows the robot to do on-axis turns in small, accurate increments. The robot was enabled to 
                            have 20 readings (18 degree increments) per 360 degree.</p>
                        <center><img src="assets/video/lab9/Orientation.png" /></center><br>
                        <p>As shown in the figure above, the yaw value acquired from IMU was tracking the value of angle_set. And it's sufficient to perform the orientation control.</p>

                        <p>In order to minimize the noise of the IMUsensor, during initialization, when the robot remains static, I record the value of the gyroscope in the z-axis a 
                            thousand times, and take the average value as the offset. So I think my angle information is more accurate. After my many attempts, the robot rotates a circle, 
                            and the angle measurement value will have a maximum error of 10 degrees. When the robot rotates a circle under the orientation control, it will drift. In some cases, 
                            it will cause the robot to be 0.5 feet (0.1524 m) away from the origin. Therefore, in the worst case, there will be an error of 0.67 m, but generally this is not the case.</p>
                        
                        <h6 class="text-secondary  text-uppercase mb-0" >2. Read out Distances</h6>
                        <p>&emsp;I will wait for a short while after sending a new angle command, let the robot read the ToF reading, and let the robot send back the 
                            distance data through Bluetooth. After testing, I set the waiting time to 2.5 seconds.</p>

                            &emsp;I put the robot in a corner of my apartment. The robot obtains ToF reading under orientation control. As shown in 
                            the picture below, the shape in the picture conforms to the shape of the corner of the wall. So the program should work.</p>

                        <p>&emsp;There are simulated robot and map in the simulator, in which the robot also displays the data of the distance sensor. We can control the linear velocity and angular velocity of the

                        <p>&emsp;At the same time, we can use Plotter functions such as plot_odom, plot_gt, plot_bel to monitor some information such as odometry, truth pose, belief, etc. in the plotter,

                        <p>&emsp;(a). As long as the robot executes the program of rotation in place whenever it approaches an obstacle, no matter how many degrees it rotates, it can avoid the obstacle. 
                            Therefore, the range of this angle is relatively broad. In my program the robot will rotate about 50 degrees.<br></p>
                        
                        <p>&emsp;(b). According to my attempts, in the simulation environment, no matter how fast the robot can avoid obstacles, I even tried 100 m/s and it worked well, so this may also be a defect of the simulator.<br></p>

                        <p>&emsp;(c).The logic of this closed loop control is that when the data returned by the robot's distance sensor is less than a certain threshold, 
                            the robot will back up and rotate again. So how close the robot can get to the obstacle depends on the data returned by the distance sensor and 
                            the choice of the threshold. Since the distance sensor has noise, the threshold value needs to be set conservatively. The threshold I set is 0.3m, that is, 
                            when the robot is less than 0.3m away from the obstacle, it will perform backward and rotate.<br></p>

                        <p>&emsp;(d). Yes, my code always work. <br></p>

                            delta_rot_1, delta_trans and delta_rot_2 are there parameters that need be calculated for the following steps. And they are calculated
                            according to the equations given in lectrue 18.

                        <p>And then use the compute_control function above twice to get the actual_u and expected_u. Combining these controls
                            with the gaussian distribution and rot_sigma/trans_sigma, the transition probability would be calculated.

                        <p>However, this way of prediction step needs 1944 to the power of 1944 iterations and takes a very long time (over one minute) to finish.
                            To simplify this step and save some time, I first loop through every belief at last time and check if its value is above

                        <p>The update step loops through every cell of the configuration space. And at each cell, get the actual sensor readings
                            (self.obs_range_data) and the expected sensor readings (self.mapper.get_views(cx, cy, ca)). Assuming that 
                            individual measurements are independent given the robot state, the likelihood of the measurements would be the product of the
                            gaussian distributions of these measurements. And then the belief at each cell can be calculated by the likelihood of the 
                            measurements times the belief_bar at each cell.

                        <p>(c) Discussion<br>
                            &emsp;The estimates of Localization in the four marker poses are accurate, the first two points are almost accurate, 
                            and the last two points have some errors in the x direction. The estimate in the all four poses has a 10 degree error in the angle. 
                            We think the reason why the estimates of the last two poses are not as accurate as those of the first two poses may be that the latter 
                            two poses are closer to the large box in the middle, and there is an error in the orientation control of the robot, so when approaching the 
                            box, the rotation angle is not accurate and the error is higher. In addition, since the ToF is located at the front end of the robot, 
                            the ToF is not collecting the exact distance from the center of the robot to the walls/obstacles, so it will cause certain errors. 
                            But when we add 0.08 meters (the distance from the ToF to the center of the robot) to all ToF readings, the result remains the same. 
                            Another possibility is that the actual box position is inconsistent with the box position in the map used by the precached true measurements.
